# CODSOFT-Task-3-Iris-Flower-Classification
# Iris Flower Classification

This project is completed as Task 3 of the CodSoft Data Science Internship.
The objective of this project is to classify Iris flowers into different species using machine learning techniques.

# 📌 Project Description

The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Using these features, a classification model is trained to predict the species of the flower:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica
